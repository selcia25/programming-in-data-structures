## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for solving complex problems efficiently in programming. This repository covers a range of data structures and algorithms in Python, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and various data structures like linked lists, binary search trees, and more.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

Here's a list of the data structures and algorithms included in this repository:

- `adjacency_matrix.py`: Implementation of an adjacency matrix for representing graphs.
- `binary_search.py`: A Python implementation of the binary search algorithm.
- `binary_search_tree.py`: Implementation of a binary search tree (BST).
- `bubble_sort.py`: Implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.
- `circularly_linked_list.py`: Implementation of a circularly linked list.
- `find_max.py`: Function to find the maximum element in an array.
- `insertion_sort.py`: Implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.
- `linear_search.py`: A Python implementation of the linear search algorithm.
